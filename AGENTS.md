# Project Overview
- Nothing to be described yet.

# Build and test commands

# Code style guidelines
- Ensure clean code practices are followed
- Do not perform any changes without having explicit confirmation from the Prompter
- Explain all changes that are going to be done
- Document any new feature in `PROJECT.md` after it was implemented for easier context update. Do it under the `Features` section in a new list item.

# Testing instructions
- Use `Jest` library for testing.
- All tests are located under the `spec` folder.
- Every feature that is implemented needs to follow Test Driven Development practices.
- Tests are the documentation of the project, so their description should not contain technical terms. They need to describe real scenarios.
